# Files for WSI HPC Bootcamp shell and make lectures

The lecture notes can be found in the [WSI wiki](http://www.woodruffscientific.com/wiki/doku.php?id=scbc2).
These files are in the initial state before any of the commands in the lecture notes have been used.
The contents of this repo should be placed in each students home directory so that they have "shell" and "make" subdirectories.
